    <h1>How to spot Gnomes and What to do</h1>
    <p>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>
            <h3>1.Record unexplained footprints in the sand.</h3>
            <p>Gnomes will actively case and probe a location before striking. It’s hard for them to get their bulbous
            bodies around the yard without leaving some tiny tracks. So when you see diminutive markings outside your
            house, please ignore your spouse’s insane opinion about how “they’re probably from those
            cute squirrels!” and automatically assume the worst. If you see tracks, that is what’s called “A Gnome Close
            Encounter of the First Kind” and it means Gnome Attack D-Day is coming up fast. It’s time to fortify the
            house and put a cap on the chimney.<br>
            <em>Note: If you hear something coming down the chimney , may I suggest loading a double-barreled shotgun so
                you
                can blow your lawn
                gnome intruder(s) straight to the bowels of hell.</em>
            </p></li>

            <h3>2.Take note of unusual ornaments.</h3>
            <p>Normal decorations are fine. Stick with shiny ornaments, normal lights, I recommend no over the top
            ornaments or little figures around your house.
            But here’s the problem: The second you start adding all kinds of unusual adornments, then your house becomes
            a perfect spot to hide in it and pretend to be just another harmless
            item. Then, when you come close to pose for that adorable family photo with all your family members
            (how fun!), that’s when the bearded agent of death leaps from its branch perch to your fleshy neck. The last
            thing you’ll think is how ironic it is that a gnome used your own holiday garland to strangle you to
            death.<br>
            <em>Note: Lit candles are also a major no-no. Go with plastic, electric lights. If you have an open
                flame
                in the house, a garden gnome will use it to light his miniature Molotov cocktail right before chucking
                it at
                your loved ones.</em>
            </p></li>
        <li>
            <h3> 3.Forget building a snowman.</h3>
            <p>A large snowman is a perfect Trojan Horse for a garden gnome to occupy before it bursts out like in the
            movie Alien and mauls you with tiny weapons and horrific shrieks. One minute you’re placing the corncob pipe
            in Frosty’s mouth thinking it the pièce de résistance in your snow creation, the next minute you’ve got a
            tiny gnome ax embedded in your shoulder while fighting for your life on the snowy ground in your
            backyard.<br>
            <em>Note: One of the most underrated weapons against gnomes is a good, sturdy snow shovel. When outside
                during
                wintertime, keep a snow shovel on hand at all times. In fact, this touches upon a bigger tip: Keep a
                weapon
                mounted on the wall in every room of your home to always be ready for when a lawn gnome armada
                invades.</em>
            </p></li>
        <li>
            <h3>4.Protect Your Drinks an Food.</h3>
            <p>Garden gnomes are highly adept at potions and alchemy. An easy way for them to take over the house is to
            simply
            poison us inside. So, on that note, make sure that you’re always keeping an eye on your drink and
            supplies.<br>
            <em>Note: Brave individuals have been known to turn this attack back on the attackers. This is how you do
                it:
                Next
                to an open Drink that you’ve “mistakenly” left unattended, place a mug of fine ale and some juicy
                gumdrops—both of which are, naturally, laced with rat poison. When that fat gnome comes in to kill you,
                they’ll
                smell the sweet scent of tasty goodies and chow down only to die 2 minutes later. Then, when you come
                across
                the
                dead gnome on your dining room table, may I suggest the gruesome-yet-effective strategy of hanging him
                outside
                for all other gnomes to see so they will promptly crap their tiny trousers and hopefully leave you the
                hell
                alone.</em>

                <h3>5.wary of lights in the wrong locations.</h3>
                <p>One precursor to a gnome hoard attack is “dancing lights” that catch your attention as they reflect
                around a
                room. This is an especially acute problem during the holidays, because you may mistake this telltale
                sign as
                mere holiday lights that another family put up in a different area. Just as you’re thinking to yourself
                I
                should
                really thank Sally for putting up these new lights that project mirth and good will, garden gnomes
                rappel
                down
                from the ceiling and attack your head while others shoot coordinated mini-arrows into your ankles. At
                that
                point, you’re totally screwed.<br>
                <em>Note: Other precursors to a full-fledged assault include the following: unexplained sawdust around
                    the
                    house,
                    the smell of pipe smoke, the power going out, and a missing pet.</em>
