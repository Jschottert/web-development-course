    <p>When one sees a statue of a garden gnome one would never realize the history and the ability to adapt that they
        hold.
        Their beginnings are much loftier than the life they hold now, residing in the suburbs among the daises and St.
        Augustine.</p>

    <p>The name Gnome quite literally means “Earth Dweller” and is synonymous with Pygmaei or as we know the term
        today, Pygmies. Once believed to stand 3-4 feet tall, masculine, strong in physique with long beards. Their
        possible history reaches back to the ancient Roman Greco era to a tribe in Greek mythology who were secondary
        deities who co existed with humans. The Gnomes were considered highly skilled in nature magic. Gnomes were seen
        as benevolent beings that were intelligent and wise, hard working in manual labor, peaceful in nature yet fierce
        defenders when necessary.(see how good they are in decieving) They were the guardians of farmland; gardens and
        small livestock and forest animals.
        When lands were under attack they rode upon goat back brandishing spears to drive out the invaders.</p>

    <p>In Roman mythology they were considered akin to the Roman fertility god Priapus protector of livestock fruit and
        gardens and considered very virile. It is believed that Gnomes are depicted consistently as male figures in
        history and rarely referenced as female in that the Gnomes were defenders of the meek and all things worthy of
        protection. It is believed they were very protective of their women and would defend them to all cost against
        predators and intruders, and later in history from humans.They despise how we humon treated them. And therefor
        plan for revenge.</p>

    <p>In Celtic and Germanic lore, the Gnomes were a tribe attributed with Earth element magic and were defenders of
        mines and under ground tunnels. It was believed that gnomes could move through the Earth and breath underground
        with the same ease their human counterparts do above ground in the air. Some associate Gnomes as descendants of
        the Dwarves of Germanic and Norse legends for the ability to move underground and the belief that Gnomes were
        skilled miners. It was thought that they helped to build under ground tunnels to hide treasures and riches of
        the fae folk after the great invasions of ancient Ireland, and from humans in modern times.</p>

    <p>The history and genealogy of the Gnomes is also believed to be traced to the Tomte or Nisse of Scandinavian
        folklore. The Tomote are sometimes believed to be an incarnation of a deceased ancestor of the home who comes
        back to defended the children and animals of the estate and would help with chores, particularly gardening and
        farm work. The Scandinavian folklore of the Tomote gave rise to the legend of and has associations with the
        winter elves who appear at Yule.</p>

    <p>The size of the Gnomes is widely accepted as a physical attribute, although some historians and mythologist
        suggest that their representation of small size was more figurative than literal in that in their possible
        origins they came form lesser spirits or gods. The modern depiction of Gnomes in literature is significantly
        smaller than what is written in ancient mythology. The modern accepted stature of a Gnome is 2-3 feet tall and
        in many instances as short as 1 foot tall.</p>

    <p>One theory between folklorist and mythologist is that Gnomes adapted to the world around them. That the Gnomes
        became smaller to better navigate an ever-increasing population of humans and development. Shape shifting to a
        smaller size helps to keep them hidden. Others believe that the gradual change of Gnomes appearance was the
        result of the Christian church marginalizing pagan deities through depictions of art and restructuring of
        legends to aid in making Christianity more palatable to Pagans. Many descriptions of Pagan deities through the
        Christian church had their attributes downplayed and magical properties lessened. Benevolent entities and
        magical creatures of Pagan nature religions were often diminished from noble in spirit to mischievous sometimes
        comical and in most instances considered dangerous as the Church weaned the populace from their previous beliefs
        to Christianity. By making these entities appear small made them seem less powerful than the Church and what
        it’s religious deities had to offer. Stories of Gnomes were homogenized more closely with legend of Dwarves and
        described as irritable, impatient, war like and ugly in appearance. The Gnomes as stoic guardians eventually
        faded into the stuff of myths.</p>

    <p>The use of small statues of Gartenzwege or garden dwarf has remained tremendously popular through out Europe
        since the 1600’s. Folks would display a small porcelain statue of a Gnome in there home as a protector. Tying to
        the legends of the Tomte. It was common practice to keep either a wooden, terracotta or ceramic Gnome in ones
        garden to act as a guardian to discourage nighttime intruders invading ones crops. A popular folk tale in the
        1970’s was that Gnome statues secretly came to life after dark working their gardens, shooing away pests. When
        the sun rose they returned to their post, turning back to stone.</p>

    <p>The industry for lawn statues grew in time with demand for garden gnomes becoming hugely popular in pre Word War
        II Germany. Most were produced from hand sculpted molds, however declined post war to only a few original family
        manufacturers. They are now mass- produced all over the world using cheaper materials. The depiction has changed
        as well. Once the imagery was more sober and wise in appearance however after release of Disney’s ‘Snow White
        and the Seven Dwarves”, Gnome statues took on the more rounded chubby appearance and became seen as more comical
        nature. Gnomes have had many depictions in literature and often interchangeable to different small statured
        magical species, affecting their representation in art and statuary.</p>

    <p>Till this day Gnomes enjoy popularity in culture. Garden Gnomes have become a central figure in games and pranks
        known as “gnoming”. One incarnation of “gnoming” is to steal a Gnome from it’s garden and place it randomly in
        another so that the Gnome travels the neighborhood, often appearing in unconventional places like on rooftops or
        inside mailboxes. Another popular fad is to send a gnome with a note attached to travel around the world to see
        how far it will go and if it will return back to it’s previous location. Some Gnomes become victims of theft
        that results in a ransom note listing bizarre demands.</p>

    <p>Perhaps the existence of Gnome like creatures has existed in so many cultures and mythologies due to their
        ability to travel great distances undetected under ground. Maybe those cheery faced, pointy hat statues
        decorating the lawns of the sub-burbs still enjoy late night adventures. All we know for sure is that they are
        everywhere. Decieving and plotting against humanity. </p>
