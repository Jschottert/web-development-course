    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p>We all think of gnomes as those happy little garden ornaments. As creatures that only exist in
        fairytale's and
        Myth's. They are doing no harm. Right? <br>
        what if i told you those story's are not true? they are mean little creatures out for world domination.
        You may
        not be aware of it. But they are infiltration as we speak. They are everywhere. Even in
        <strong>YOUR</strong>
        House!
        On these page i will explain things further. And maybe even help you to keep your house a bit more safe.
        I must
        admit i am not a expert on this. But i may be able to raise some awareness. And hopefully keeping your
        House and
        loveones a bit more safe

    <p> While we don’t know why gnomes attack us. We can be certain that they want us all dead. In 2016, the Gnome
        Defense Hotline based in Berlin has recorded 1,017 confirmed attacks worldwide.
        If you live anywhere close to garden gnomes or reside on rural property near the woods, rest assured that an
        assault is not “possible.” It is inevitable. They’re coming. The only question is when.</p>
